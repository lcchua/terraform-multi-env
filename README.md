# Terraform Multi Env with Terraform Workspace

### Overview
There would be times when you need to manage multiple environments (dev, uat, prod etc.) from the same terraform code repository. Instead of using a git branching strategy to manage the different environments (1 tfstate file per branch), you can also use terraform workspaces

### What is terraform workspaces?
Workspaces in Terraform are simply independently managed state files. A workspace contains everything that Terraform needs to manage a given collection of infrastructure, and separate Workspaces function like completely separate working directories. We can manage multiple environments with Workspaces.

Deletion/ destruction of one workspace will not impact the resources on another.

### What will we need to create terraform workspace?
1. Install terraform

### High level concepts
1. variable.tf = Stores the variables that we will use to inject into our main.tf files. These variables are all empty, and we will fetch the values from tfvars files.
2. tfvars files = Stores the exact values based on the environment that we are targeting.
3. main.tf = Stores the provider block and the resource block for S3 creation.

### Steps
1. After cloning this repository, make the necessary amendments to the dev.tfvars, uat.tfvars and prod.tfvars files with your own variable values; Replace the existing values.
2. Create the different terraform workspaces:
- Run `terraform init` followed by `terraform workspace new dev` to create a dev workspace, `terraform workspace new uat` to create a uat workspace, `terraform workspace new prod` to create a prod workspace.
- Run `terraform workspace list` to view all the workspaces you have.

The "*" indicates the current workspace you are in.

- Run `terraform workspace select dev` to switch to the dev environment.

3. Inject the values from the terraform tfvars file into the variable.tf file to be used by the main.tf file.
- To do a plan for Dev environment, be sure to switch to the correct workspace, followed by `terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars`. This will inject the values from the dev.tfvars file into main.tf and the output of the S3 bucket name will correspond to the variables from dev.tfvars.

- The same steps can be done for your uat and prod environments as well.

### Where are my terraform state files stored?
Terraform will store your state files in terraform.tfstate.d folder, separated by each environment (dev, uat, prod). Each workspace has its own tfstate file.

### Further steps
If you would like to use Github Actions to run these pipelines, you may want to consider the below:
1. Remove any credentials from your local machine (AWS Secrets/ Access Keys) and upload them in Github Actions Secrets
2. Add the backend.tf file to store your state files on S3.
3. Add your .github/workflow/main.yml file that contains your Github Actions CI/CD steps which should include configuring AWS credentials, terraform init, terraform select workspace <env>, terraform plan -var-file=<env>.tfvars
